title: Using Canon DSLRs with Ecamm Live
---

## Introduction

In this tutorial we’ll show you how to use your  Canon <abbr title="Digital Single-lens Reflex">DSLR</abbr> with Ecamm Live, without the need for any additional hardware.

Cameras with interchangeable lenses, like Canon’s DSLRs, can produce the best video out there. If you’ve been shooting with webcams, these cameras provide a serious upgrade to your broadcast quality.

Ecamm Live can broadcast any digital camera source available on your Mac. For external cameras the choices are USB (typically webcams), Firewire (sometimes called “iLink”—typically older digital video cameras like camcorders), or HDMI. HDMI is the current standard connection for high-quality video input, but since Macs don’t have a built-in HDMI input, an HDMI capture device is typically required. 

However, Ecamm Live features special support for Canon DSLR video input, using just a USB cable. With the use of simple free software called Camera Live, you can skip the extra hardware.

If you don’t already have a DSLR and are reading this tutorial because you want to learn what involved in upgrading your equipment, check [the last section of this tutorial for some ideas](../003-camera-details/#if-you-dont-yet-have-a-dslr) for you.

## Camera Compatibility

Canon DSLR camera compatibility with Ecamm Live depends entirely upon the support within Camera Live, a piece of free, open source software written by Tom Butterworth & Anton Marini. With this software installed, Ecamm Live will be able to use any video Camera Live brings into your Mac.

Their software, which we will download later in this tutorial, is sporadically updated for compatibility with new cameras. To check if your Canon is compatible, visit their camera list and search for your model name. You may have to scroll the text horizontally to see all model names.

## Necessary Camera Hardware

To connect your compatible Canon camera to your Mac, you must use a USB cable. Our cable is a Mini-USB-to-USB-A cable, but your camera may have a different port. We use one with a 90° bend at the camera end, which makes routing the cable easier in our setup. Make sure to purchase a USB cable with generous length, or add a USB extension cable. Too-short cables limit your camera placement options, are are easy to trip over. Make sure your cables always have slack. Tension on cables can damage the ports on your devices. If you have a newer Mac with only USB-C ports, you may need an adapter from USB-A to USB-C.

Some Canon models have an LCD display that swivels out of the body, and can be pointed forward towards the the subject being filmed. If your model has this feature, and the ports are also on the same side of the camera, the 90° cable will reduce how much the screen is blocked.

When using a Canon DSLR via USB, audio from the camera’s built-in microphone(s) is not available. You will need to use a different audio source. We strongly recommend a quality external microphone that compliments the image quality your camera produces. In many ways, audio quality is more important to a broadcast than video quality, so invest wisely.
