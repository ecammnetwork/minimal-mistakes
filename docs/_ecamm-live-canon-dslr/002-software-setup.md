## Setting up the Camera Live Software

Once you’ve verified that your Canon is compatible, [download the Camera Live app from the GitHub releases page](https://github.com/v002/v002-Camera-Live/releases). At the top of that page, find the Build labeled “Latest Release” and then select the “Camera.Live.zip” link to begin the download.

Once the software is downloaded, find the file, typically in your Downloads folder. If the file did not automatically unzip, double-click the .zip file and it will automatically unzip. Place the resulting Camera Live app in your Applications folder.

Before launching the software, make sure you have the latest firmware installed on your camera. Firmware updates are available for free from [Canon’s Support website](https://global.canon/en/support/).

If you have the Canon EOS Utility running on your Mac, quit the app before running Camera Live. If you do not have EOS Utility installed, it is not necessary for Camera Live to work.

## First-run Setup

Some Canon models have Wi-Fi or Wi-Fi and NFC wireless connections. These must be disabled in the camera’s on-screen settings to allow Camera Live to receive video from your camera. You’ll also want to disable Auto Power off while shooting video, to prevent your camera from turning off automatically. (If you also shoot stills with your camera, remember to re-enable this feature to save your battery).

With the camera powered off, connect your camera to your Mac via USB. If possible, connect the USB cable directly to your Mac. Connections through USB hubs may not connect or be reliable for high-bandwidth devices, such as cameras. 

To launch Camera Live, double click the application’s icon. The app has a small window. At the top of the window is a status display, and at the bottom is a list of connected cameras.

Once Camera Live is running, power up your camera. On cameras that have a video camera icon on the On/off switch, you can slide the selector to the video camera icon. On our model, this provides a Live View on the LCD display.

On the Camera Live app, you should see the camera name appear in the list, and the status display move from <samp>No camera</samp> to <samp>Starting</samp> to <samp>Active</samp>, and you’ll hear the mirror in your camera click open.

If the app does not show <samp>Active</samp> in the status area, shut down the camera, and then quit the app. Open the app first, before powering up the connected camera.

Once the Camera Live reads <samp>Active</samp>, Ecamm Live will immediately list <samp>Camera Live</samp> as an option in the <samp>Camera</samp> menu. Switch Ecamm Live to the Camera Source mode by selecting the camera icon at the top of the Main Window, or in the Source menu.

If the Camera Live source is not available in the source switcher at the bottom of the Main Window, select it in the <samp>Camera</samp> ➝ <samp>Include in Switcher…</samp> menu. To select the Camera Live source, click its preview box in the source switcher at the bottom of the Main Window, or select it under the <samp>Camera</samp> menu.

You will now see your Canon’s video feed in Ecamm Live’s Main Window.

## Day to Day Use

Ecamm Live continuously monitors your system for camera inputs, so you can launch Ecamm Live and Camera Live in any order. However, remember to power on your connected camera only after you launch Camera Live.

When you’re done filming, you can shut off the camera and quit the app.
