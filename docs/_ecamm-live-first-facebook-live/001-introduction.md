* Recap.

**Note:** If you’ve never opened Ecamm Live before, you may want to read the [first couple of paragraphs of the User’s Manual](../../ecamm-live-manual/001-welcome) describing what happens the first time you open the app, and get a tour of the app’s Main Window. Throughout this tutorial, we’ll link out to important concepts in the [Ecamm Live Online User’s Manual.](../ecamm-live-manual/001-welcome) If you need additional information, click out, then come back here and continue when you’re ready.
