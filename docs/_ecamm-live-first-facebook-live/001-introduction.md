In this tutorial, we’ll discuss how to do a single camera, “talking head”-style Facebook Live broadcast. You’ll see how Ecamm Live tools, along with a little planning and preparation, can help you make a simple and impactful Facebook Live broadcast.

* Before You Broadcast: A basic setup for Facebook Live.
* How to start and end your very first broadcast.
* After your broadcast: what to do next.

* Recap.

**Note:** If you’ve never opened Ecamm Live before, you may want to read the [first couple of paragraphs of the Manual](../../ecamm-live-manual/001-welcome) describing what happens the first time you open the app, and get a tour of the app’s Main Window. Throughout this tutorial, we’ll link out to important concepts in the [Ecamm Live Online Manual.](../../ecamm-live-manual/001-welcome) If you need additional information, click out, then come back here and continue when you’re ready.
