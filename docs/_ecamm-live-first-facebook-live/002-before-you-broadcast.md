title: "Before You Broadcast: A Basic Setup for Facebook Live"
---

If you haven’t logged into Facebook through Ecamm Live yet, now is the time. At the bottom of the Ecamm Live main window is a big blue button. If it reads <samp class="blue">Login</samp>, press it, and follow through the prompts to connect the app to Facebook.

**Note:** If the big blue button reads <samp class="blue">Record</samp> you’re in local recording mode, which will only save your work to a local video file on your Mac, and broadcast nothing. In the bottom right corner of the Main Window, next to <samp>Destination:</samp> select <samp>Facebook</samp>. If you’re not logged into Facebook, you’ll see <samp class="blue">Login</samp> appear on the big blue button. Click it and log in now.

If the big blue button reads <samp class="blue">Go Live</samp>—you’ve already logged into Facebook. Great, your work here is done.

Once you’re logged in, you’re only one click away from your first Facebook Live broadcast. However, you’ll want to verify where and to whom you are broadcasting first. In the bottom right corner, you’ll see several pull down menus appearing under the <samp>Destination</samp> menu.

* <samp>Post to:</samp> — this controls where your Facebook Live broadcast will appear, and lists your Profile, and Pages and Groups you administer.
* <samp>Broadcast to:</samp> — this controls the privacy of your Live broadcast when broadcasting to your Profile. You may select <samp>Only Me</samp>, <samp>Friends</samp>, <samp>Friends of Friends</samp>, <samp>Everyone</samp>. 
* <samp>Go Live:</samp> — this controls when your broadcast will post to Facebook. Your choices are <samp>Now</samp> and <samp>New Scheduled Live…</samp> For this tutorial, we'll use <samp>Now</samp>.

Set these options to your liking. Let's review a few more settings before clicking <samp class="blue">Go Live</samp>.


## Your Video Source

Top center of the Main Window is your source switcher. Your options, left-to-right, are cameras, screen sharing, or local video. For this tutorial, we'll do a one-camera setup, and we'll leave the other source options alone for now.

Select the {% inlineicon cam 20 graybutton %}Camera Icon{% endinlineicon %} camera icon, if it's not already. The main window should be filled with a live preview of your camera's video. If you have more than one camera attached right now, a Video Source Switcher appears on screen. You can see live previews of video from all available sources. Click a preview to switch to that source. Video sources can be hidden from the switcher. If a source is missing, check the Cameras Menu at the top of your display. <samp>Camera</samp> menu ➝ <samp>Include in switcher</samp> ➝ un/check sources listed here.

## Checking Audio

Let's make sure your audio source is working properly, and make sure your levels are set. If the Sound Window is not visible on screen, click the {% inlineicon sliders 20 graybutton %}Camera Icon{% endinlineicon %} sound sliders icon, in the top right of the Main Window to summon it.

The Sound Window will show what audio source is being used. Clicking on the name of the source will display a menu with all available sources. Once selected, a meter will show the source's volume level. You can adjust this with the slider. Speak to test the levels, and if you see red often at the right end of the meter, adjust the slider knob to the left. If you see little green, slide it to the right to turn up your volume.

There's a setting for <samp>Movie audio</samp>. We won't need that in this tutorial. You should leave <samp>Echo cancellation</samp> on, if you're listening to your stream through speakers. Echo cancellation listens to the audio coming through your mic, and cancels it if it believes that audio came from your speakers. If you're using headphones, this setting doesn't matter.

Need to mute your microphone? <samp>Microphone</samp> menu ➝ <samp>Mute Microphone</samp>, or press <kbd>shift</kbd><kbd title="command">⌘</kbd><kbd>M</kbd>.

## Overlay and Scenes Windows

You may see an Overlays Window and a Scenes Window. We won't use these until the end of this tutorial [your second broadcast](../005-second-broadcast-overlays-scenes). You may safely close these for now, if you wish.

## Comments and Reactions Window

While you're broadcasting, if someone in your audience comments or clicks a reaction icon (thumbs up, angry face, etc.) you'll see a running tally of them here. Place this window somewhere convenient. We'll look at it again shortly.
