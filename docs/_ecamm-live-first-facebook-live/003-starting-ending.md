## Start Your Broadcast

Click <samp class="blue">Go Live</samp>. 

Within a few seconds, _you're Live!_ What you do now is up to you.

## During Your Broadcast and Audience Interactions

Once you have an audience, if they choose to send comments or reactions, you'll see them appear in the Comments and Reactions Window. If you wish to share them with the audience, you can click <samp>Create Overlay</samp>, or simply _drag_ the comment into the Main Window, and drop it where you want to create a Comment Overlay.

Ecamm Live will style the Comment Overlay with the default style, or your most recently used style. Place your cursor over the Comment Overlay to see editing controls. Click the {Pencil icon}#todo if you want to edit its style. You can move it around by dragging it, and resize it by dragging at the edge of the Overlay, by using the scroll feature of your mouse, or pinching/spreading your fingers on a trackpad. When you're done with the Comment Overlay, hover your cursor over it, and then click the {X icon}#todo to remove it.
