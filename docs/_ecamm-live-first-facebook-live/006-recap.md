Before you broadcast, you need to plan two things (in addition to your actual content). 

First, consider the logistics of where and when you plan to broadcast within Facebook. For example, you may want to broadcast on your business's Page, but without pre-scheduling a time. 

Second, you can add another degree of polish to your broadcast with Overlays. Figuring them out ahead of time, and then arranging them within thoughtful Scenes allows you to navigate through your broadcast with a minimum of effort. This leaves more attention and energy for making your performance on the stream the best it can be.
