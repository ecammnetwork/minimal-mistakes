## Getting Keynote Ready

There are two ways to get Keynote ready for broadcast without having your audience watch you open Keynote and put it into presentation mode.

### Command+Tab method

You can put Keynote into full screen presentation mode before your broadcast, switch to your presentation scene, and then use Command + Tab to switch to Keynote. This would minimize the “backstage” things the audience would see as you transition to the slideshow.

### Set and Switch

While you’re in camera mode (where the audience cannot see your screen), open your Keynote file, and put it into presentation mode. When you’re ready to show the slideshow, from the floating Ecamm Live window above your full screen slideshow, use the scene switcher to switch to the screen share scene you created in the previous section.

## How to Leave Keynote when you’re done

Use the Ecamm live floating window to select a scene without screen share mode.
