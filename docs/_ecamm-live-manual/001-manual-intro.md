# Welcome

Welcome to the Ecamm Live User’s Manual. In this manual, you’ll learn…
* The capabilities of Ecamm Live and what advantages you gain by using it.
* In-depth description of all the features and tools of the app, and where to find the all the primary features.

## What can Ecamm Live do? Why should I use it instead of the basic tools services like Facebook Live offer?

Ecamm Live is a macOS app designed to give you tremendous control over live streaming, with special capabilities for Facebook Live. Ecamm Live can broadcast to any streaming service that uses *RTMP* technology. Compatible services include YouTube, Periscope, restream.io, and others.

Why would you choose to use a Mac app to live stream, when you can stream straight from your web browser, or mobile device? Because Ecamm Live gives you superpowers…
* **Create Text and Graphics overlays** atop your broadcast, on-the-fly, or build them ahead of time.
* When broadcasting to Facebook Live, **view a live feed of your comments and reactions.** 
* **Add Facebook comments to your broadcast.** Simply drag them onto the window and they appear automatically as overlays.
* **Conduct live video interviews** with as many as 5 remote guests via Skype (requires Ecamm Call Recorder for Skype).
* **Use external video sources.** including **HDMI** sources, and **Canon DSLRs**. **Switch easily between all video sources** with a click or keyboard shortcut.
* **Share your screen:** put any window, app, or display from your Mac right into your stream. This also enables the use of presentation software, such as **Apple Keynote, or Microsoft PowerPoint.**
* **Playback local video files** right into your broadcast.
* **Create Picture-in-picture video** boxes on top of your stream.
* Set the shape of your stream, go wide, tall, or squarish.
* Create Scenes which are preset groups of almost any of the above features, which you can **trigger with a click or keyboard shortcut.**
* Schedule Facebook Live broadcasts from within the app and broadcast to your Profile, Pages, Groups, and Events.
* All streams are **automatically recorded** to a file on your Mac.
* You can also **record a video without broadcasting.** Great for practicing, or pre-recording presentations.
  
Incredible, right? Must be difficult? *Challenge accepted.*
