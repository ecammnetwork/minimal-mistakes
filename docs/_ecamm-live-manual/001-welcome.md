## What can Ecamm Live do?

Ecamm Live is a macOS app designed to give you tremendous control over live streaming, with special capabilities for Facebook Live, YouTube Live, LinkedIn, Twitch, Restream.io and Switchboard Live. Ecamm Live can broadcast to any streaming service that uses *RTMP* streaming.

Why would you choose to use a Mac app to live stream, when you can stream straight from your web browser, or mobile device? Because Ecamm Live gives you superpowers…
* **Add text, scrolling tickers, images, countdowns, PDFs and animations to your broadcast as overlays** , on-the-fly, or build them ahead of time.
* When broadcasting to Facebook Live, YouTube Live, Restream, and Twitch **view a live feed of your comments and reactions.** 
* **Add viewer comments to your broadcast.** Simply drag them onto the window and they appear automatically as overlays.
* **Conduct live video interviews** with up to 4 remote guests.
* **Use external video sources** including **HDMI** sources, **Canon DSLRs**, NDI inputs and more. **Switch easily between all video sources** with a click or keyboard shortcut.
* **Share your screen:** put any window, app, or display from your Mac right into your stream. This also enables the use of presentation software, such as **Apple Keynote, or Microsoft PowerPoint.**
* **Roll pre-recorded video files** right into your broadcast.
* **Play music and sound effects** in your broadcast.
* **Use a green screen** to easily add a digital backdrop.
* **Add Picture-in-picture video** to your stream.
* Set the shape of your stream: go wide, tall, or square.
* Create Scenes, which are preset groups of almost any of the above features, which you can **trigger with a click or keyboard shortcut.**
* Schedule Facebook, YouTube Live or Restream broadcasts.
* All streams are **automatically recorded** to your Mac.
* You can also **record a video without broadcasting.** Great for practicing, or pre-recording presentations.
  
Incredible, right? Must be difficult? *Challenge accepted.*
