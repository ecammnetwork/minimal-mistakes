<!-- ## Your First Time Around with Ecamm Live -->

See also the [First Facebook Live tutorial](/ecamm-live-first-facebook-live/001-first-facebook-live-intro) for the bare essentials from first-run to your first Facebook Live broadcast.

Upon opening Ecamm Live, you’ll be greeted by the Main Window, and several smaller windows.
 
## The Main Window

The Main Window is your monitor of what your audience sees, except the tools we’ve laid on top of this window—and your cursor—which are only visible to you. You can resize the main window by dragging from any edge or corner of the window.

The smaller windows are for control of [Sound Levels](../004-source-modes/#the-sound-levels-window), [Scenes](../005-using-scenes), [Overlays](../003-using-overlays), and [Comments and Reactions.](../003-using-overlays/#facebook-comment-overlays) If you dismiss any of these windows, you can bring them back by visiting the <samp>Windows</samp> menu at the very top of your Mac’s display. Additionally, each of these windows has a keyboard shortcut assigned for easy access.

At the center bottom of the Main Window is a blue <samp class="blue">Login</samp> button, which will allow us to connect you to Facebook, YouTube or Periscope.

Note: If you’re not going to use Ecamm Live with Facebook, YouTube or Periscope, logging in is optional. You can still record to your Mac, and stream to services that use [RTMP](../007-broadcast-to-rtmp).

## Tools within the Main Window

At the top left of the Main Window is the <samp>Scenes</samp> pull-down button. The text of the button shows the name of your currently active Scene. Any other Scenes you’ve created are listed within the menu, giving you fast access to switching scenes during a stream or recording. Reference our section on [Scenes](../005-using-scenes) for more details on what Scenes are, and how to use them.

At the top center of the Main Window you’ll find Ecamm Live’s three primary modes— we call them Sources— you can use in your broadcast.

{% inlineicon cam 20 graybutton %}Camera Icon{% endinlineicon %} [Camera](../004-source-modes/#camera)

{% inlineicon screen 20 graybutton %}Screen Icon{% endinlineicon %} [Screen Share](../004-source-modes/#screen-share)

{% inlineicon video 20 graybutton %}Video Icon{% endinlineicon %} [Video File](../004-source-modes/#video-files)

The top right of the Main Window contains two icons, the <samp>Sound Levels</samp> button, and the <samp>Overlays</samp> button. Both show or hide the windows for each tool.

{% inlineicon sliders 45 graybutton %}Sound Levels Button{% endinlineicon %} [Sound Levels](../004-source-modes/#the-sound-levels-window)

{% inlineicon overlays 65 graybutton %}Overlays Button{% endinlineicon %} [Overlays](../003-using-overlays)

The five links above go to the manual's sections for each source and explain each in detail.

The bottom right corner holds menus which control where your broadcasts go. The options here are dependent upon which settings you’ve selected.

If you've picked Facebook, YouTube or Periscope as your Destination, you’ll see various options of where to broadcast. You can choose who can view your broadcast within Facebook or YouTube, and control when to broadcast.

If you select <samp>Custom Stream Key</samp>, a sheet will appear over the window with the settings required to [stream to services other than Facebook, YouTube and Periscope.](../007-broadcast-to-rtmp)

Lastly, if you select <samp>Record Only</samp>, all the other options fade away, and you’re now set to [capture a recording only to your Mac.](../008-local-recordings)

The bottom center of the Main Window holds the big blue button which depending on the destinations settings can read,

<samp class="blue">Login</samp>
: If you’re not logged in, but have the <samp>Destination</samp> set to Facebook, YouTube or Periscope.

<samp class="blue">Go Live</samp>
: If you’re logged into Facebook, YouTube or Periscope and have the relevant <samp>Destination</samp> picked, or if you’re using a stream key.

<samp class="blue">Record</samp>
: If your <samp>Destination</samp> is set to <samp>Record Only</samp>

When using Facebook Live, the bottom left corner of the Main Window includes a {% inlineicon locbutton 20 inverted %}Location Button{% endinlineicon %}  location pin and description field.

Text entered in the description field will become the text of the post that accompanies your Facebook Live, YouTube or Periscope broadcast.

**Note:** We have [a detailed section on Facebook Live](../006-broadcast-to-facebook) later in this manual.  We discuss Custom Stream Keys and how to connect to other video services in the [Broadcast to RTMP-based Services](../007-broadcast-to-rtmp) section.
