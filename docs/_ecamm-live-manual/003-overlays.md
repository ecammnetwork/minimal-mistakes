# Using Overlays

Overlays are styled text and images in your broadcast. You can access Overlays by clicking the {% inlineicon overlays 65 graybutton %} in the upper right corner of the Main Window, or through the Overlays menu at the very top of your display. There are four types of Overlays:

## Text Overlays

Almost any need for text on the screen can be addressed with Text Overlays. There are 5 ways you can display a Text Overlay:

* Select New Text Overlay in the Overlays pull-down button in the Main Window
* Select New Text Overlay in the Overlays menu at the top of your display
* Click the {% inlineicon addtext 20 inverted %} button at the bottom the Overlays Window,
* Type <kbd>‚åò</kbd><kbd>N</kbd>.

Copy text from anywhere on your Mac. <samp>Edit</samp> menu > <samp>Paste</samp> as Overlay will allow you to paste in plain or styled text.

When you create a new Text Overlay, a Text Editing Sheet will appear. Start typing to enter text. You can hold the <kbd>shift</kbd> key and press the <kbd>return</kbd> key to insert a line break. You can change many properties  including font, font size, text color, text opacity (how much you can ‚Äúsee through‚Äù the text), background color and background opacity. You can apply any of these properties to individual lines or chunks of the text by highlighting them, and selecting your styles.

You can apply a shadow or an outer glow effect to all of the text. To add emoji, click the üòÄ button and select from the menu.

The background size and shape is set automatically for you, and adjusts to scale with the size of your text. You can change the color and the opacity of the background by clicking the style button after the <samp>Background:</samp> label. Click this button again to return to text editing options.

Once you click <samp>Save</samp> in the Text Editing Sheet, your Overlay will appear on the main window screen.

### Editing Text Overlays

To position a text overlay, place your cursor in the middle of the overlay and drag. If you‚Äôd like to adjust the overlay‚Äôs size, hover your cursor in the bottom right-hand corner of the overlay, and look for it to change to arrows. Drag to adjust the size. You may also use your trackpad‚Äôs pinch-to-zoom gesture, or your mouse‚Äôs scroll gesture to resize any overlay.

If you‚Äôd like to change the text or visual style of the overlay, place your cursor over the overlay. Two icons will appear on its left. The {% inlineicon pencil 30 %} brings back the Text Editing Sheet for adjustments. A double-click on the Overlay will also bring back the Text Editing Sheet.

If you would like to hide the Text Overlay from the screen, place your cursor over the overlay. Two icons will appear on its left. The {% inlineicon x 30 %} hides the text overlay.  You can bring the Text Overlay back to the screen by clicking the {% inlineicon visible 20 inverted %} next to the name of the Text Overlay in the Overlays Window, or selecting it from the Overlays Menu at the top of your display.

To resize an overlay after creating it, place your cursor over the right edge of the overlay. When the cursor switched to a double arrow, drag to resize. 

## Image Overlays

Would you like to show your company logo in the corner of your broadcast? That‚Äôs one of the most common uses for Image Overlays. But there are many possibilities. If you‚Äôd like to go beyond the styling capabilities of Text Overlays, you can design text in a design program, such as Photoshop or Pixelmator, save them as an image, and add them to your broadcast as an Image Overlay. This is a powerful way to supplement your broadcast‚Äôs branding. You can simply drag and drop any supported image file on the Main Window or Overlays Window to instantly create a new Overlay. Or if you prefer, there are 4 other ways to create an Image Overlay:

* Select <samp>New Image Overlay</samp> in the <samp>Overlays</samp> pull-down button in the Main Window
* Select <samp>New Image Overlay</samp> in the <samp>Overlays</samp> menu at the top of your display
* Click the {% inlineicon addimage 50 inverted %} button at the bottom the <samp>Overlays</samp> Window
* Type <kbd>shift</kbd><kbd>‚åò</kbd><kbd>N</kbd> while in the Main Window.

A File Selection Sheet will appear, allowing you to find and select one image file. Select a JPEG, PNG or GIF. Animated GIFs are also supported‚Äîlet‚Äôs use that last one responsibly, shall we? 

**ProTip:** When creating an image in an external graphics application for an overlay, PNG is a great format. PNG saves losslessly (without visible degradation from data compression), and can have an alpha channel (allowing parts of the image to be transparent). This can add an additional pro touch to your onscreen look. If you‚Äôre interested in a fancy ‚Äúlower third‚Äù or ‚Äúchyron‚Äù graphic, create a PNG in your graphics editor of choice and use it as an Image Overlay in Ecamm Live.

### Editing Image Overlays

To reposition the Text overlay, place your cursor in the middle of the Overlay and drag. If you‚Äôd like to adjust the Overlay‚Äôs size, hover your cursor above an edge, and look for it to change to arrows. Drag to adjust the size. You may also use your mouse or trackpad‚Äôs scroll feature, or your trackpad‚Äôs pinch-to-zoom feature to resize any Overlay.

If you would like to hide the Image Overlay from the screen, place your cursor over the overlay. The {% inlineicon x 30 %} will appear on the left. It hides the Image Overlay from the Main Window (and current Scene). You can bring the Image Overlay back to the screen by clicking the {% inlineicon visible 20 inverted %} next to the name of the Image Overlay within the Overlays Window, or selecting it from the <samp>Overlays</samp> Menu at the top of your display.

## Facebook Comment Overlays

If you‚Äôre broadcasting with Facebook Live, and you receive a comment on Facebook, you can drag that comment from the Comments and Reactions Window into the Main Window. Ecamm will automatically convert your comment into a styled text overlay, matching the style of your most recent comment overlay. If you want two different Comment Overlays to appear on screen at once, drag a second comment to the Main Window.

You can also click the <samp>Create Overlay</samp> button in the Comments & Reactions window to place a comment on screen. This feature remembers the placement and style of a previous Comment Overlay. If there‚Äôs currently a Comment Overlay on screen, clicking a different comment in the Comments & Reactions window will replace the currently displayed Comment Overlay. This is useful for clicking through a series of Comment in succession.

### Editing Facebook Comment Overlays

The text in a comment overlay can be edited and styled just like a [Text Overlay](link to Editing Text Overlays). Once a Comment Overlay is styled, future comments remember this styling indefinitely, unless you restyle it.

## Countdown Overlays

If you need to display a countdown timer on screen, use a Countdown Overlay. 

There are 3 ways you can display a Countdown Overlay:

* Select <samp>New Countdown Overlay</samp> in the #todo:image Overlays pull-down button in the Main Window
* Select <samp>New Countdown Overlay</samp> in the <samp>Overlays</samp> menu at the top of your display
* Click the {% inlineicon addcountdown 50 inverted %} button at the bottom the Overlays Window.

A Text Editing Sheet appears, providing all of the same visual styling options as with a Text Overlay. You can edit the End Time and text alignment. Ecamm Live will display a countdown to the chosen End Time. Press <samp>Save</samp> to display your timer within the Main Window.

### Editing Countdown Overlays

You have the same controls as [Text Overlays](link to Editing Text Overlays).

## Overlay Quick Resize Options

Does any Overlay need a quick resize while on screen? Place your cursor over an edge or corner, wait until the cursor change to the resizing arrow, and then drag to make the Overlay bigger or smaller. 

If you‚Äôre using a mouse, you can put your cursor over top of the Overlay and scroll to change the size. If you‚Äôre using a trackpad, use the ‚Äúpinch‚Äù or ‚Äúspread‚Äù zooming gestures.

## Managing Your Overlays

The Overlays Window offers several options for managing your Overlays. 

To delete an overlay, select any item in the list and press your delete key, drag to the {% inlineicon trash 15 inverted %} icon, or click the {% inlineicon trash 15 inverted %} icon. The item will vanish. Trash an overlay by mistake? Don‚Äôt panic. <samp>Edit</samp> > <samp>Undo</samp> or <kbd>‚åò</kbd><kbd>Z</kbd> will bring it back. 

You can show or hide a given overlay by clicking its {% inlineicon visible 20 inverted %} icon. You can reorder the overlays by dragging them up or down. This can be helpful for organization, but if you have any overlays that overlap, the items that are listed higher on the list are ‚Äúabove‚Äù the items lower on the list. This is called z-order or z-index.

If you need to further organize, you can create folders to group overlays. Click the {% inlineicon addgroup 50 inverted %} icon to create a new folder. Drag overlays onto the folders to organize.

**Note:** Overlays are always auto-saved as you create and edit them.
