When you need to play a video file within your live broadcast, use the third icon in the Sources Bar, the {% inlineicon video 20 graybutton %}Video Icon{% endinlineicon %} icon. Clicking this the first time will display a file browser, allowing you to locate and select a video file for feedback.

On subsequent clicks of the Video icon, you'll see a  menu appear instead, with additional options. <samp>Choose File</samp> brings up the File Browser to choose a new video. A <samp>Recent</samp> section lists any videos you've previously selected during this broadcast. Selecting a video from this list will immediately play the video filling your broadcast window. If your <samp>Recent Videos</samp> section needs a clean up, select <samp>Clear Recent Items</samp>. 

Your video will begin playing _immediately_ after selection. If you would prefer to disable autoplay, you may do so in the <samp>Video</samp> section of the <samp>Preferences</samp>.  

### When A Video File Ends

If you'd like to have the selected video start over automatically as soon as it finished, choose <samp>Options</samp> menu ➝ <samp>When Video Ends</samp>  ➝ <samp>Loop Video</samp>.

If you'd like to go to the next [Scene](../007-using-scenes/) when the video finishes, choose <samp>Options</samp> menu ➝ <samp>When Video Ends</samp>  ➝ <samp>Go To Next Scene</samp>.

Audio from the video will be broadcast automatically.  Your microphone will be automatically muted if a Picture in Picture box for your camera is not present. Read the [Picture-in-Picture section](#picture-in-picture) for full details.

While the video plays, you can control it with the Video Control Bar. Only you can see the controller. It is invisible to your audience. You can drag this control bar around the window if it's blocking your view. The bar fades in and out depending on the movement of your cursor. Audio from the video file can be monitored and adjusted in the [Sound Levels](../013-adjusting-sound-levels/) Window.

## Picture in Picture

Picture-in-Picture can be summoned or dismissed by clicking the leftmost icon  {% inlineicon pip 20 inverted %}Picture-in-Picture Button{% endinlineicon %} in the onscreen controls, or using the <samp>Options</samp> menu ➝ <samp>Show Picture-in-Picture</samp>. The PiP box can be moved anywhere within the Main Window. It features a mute toggle button only visible to you, for your microphone. You can change the size of the PiP by dragging the bottom right corner of it. 

You can change the shape of the PiP window <samp>Options</samp> ➝ <samp>Picture-in-Picture Shape</samp>, or by right-clicking or control-clicking on the PiP window. Shape options include a rectangle, square or circle.

In video playback mode, your microphone and Skype audio are automatically muted when the PiP window is not on screen. Only the video's audio will play. When the PiP window is brought back, your audio is automatically unmuted. You can unmute (and mute again) your mic audio while a video is playing and the PiP is hidden by clicking the microphone icon within the video control bar, or by using the <samp>MUTE</samp> buttons in the [Sound Levels](../013-adjusting-sound-levels) window.
