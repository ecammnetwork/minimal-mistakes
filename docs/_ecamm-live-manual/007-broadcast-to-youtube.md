Broadcasting to YouTube starts in the <samp>Destination</samp> menu, in the bottom right of the Main Window. Select <samp>YouTube</samp>. The YouTube Login button will appear at the bottom of the Main Window.

If you've never logged into YouTube with Ecamm Live, click <samp class="blue">Login</samp> now, and follow through the prompts.

If you haven't broadcasted live to your YouTube account previously, you'll need to enable the option by visiting [your Live Dashboard first](<https://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard_splash>), before you'll be able to broadcast to YouTube.

\#Todo - screenshot of what happens if you've not enabled live streaming first when you try to broadcast.

Once you're logged in, you can dive straight in by clicking <samp class="blue">Go Live</samp>, but there are a couple of options you'll want to check out first.

## YouTube Live Broadcast Options

YouTube assigns a category to its live broadcasts. You can choose your category under <samp>Options</samp> ➝ <samp>YouTube Video Category</samp>.

Under the <samp>Destination</samp> menu, you have two options to set. 

<samp>Broadcast to</samp> - <samp>Public</samp>, <samp>Unlisted</samp>, <samp>Private</samp>.

* <samp>Public</samp> will create a video that shows on your channel.
* <samp>Unlisted</samp> will create a video that is available only if the viewer has a direct link to the broadcast. It will be otherwise unfindable to the public.
* <samp>Private</samp> will create a video that is only available to you.

<samp>Go Live</samp> - <samp>Now (Unscheduled)</samp> or <samp>New Scheduled Live…</samp>

<samp>Now (Unscheduled)</samp> will begin your video without a prior announcement.

## Ending a YouTube Live Broadcast

Click <samp class="blue">Finish</samp>.

(That's it.)

## Post-broadcast options

After clicking <samp class="blue">Finish</samp> we'll present you with a message confirming your broadcast has ended, and offer several options for your next steps.

On YouTube, a recording of your Live broadcast is now available within your account, according to your <samp>Broadcast to</samp> settings, automatically. 

<samp>{% inlineicon visible 15 inverted %}View Post{% endinlineicon %} View Post</samp> - click to reveal the post in your default web browser.

<samp>{% inlineicon trash 15 inverted %}Trash Button{% endinlineicon %} Delete Post</samp> - click to remove the post from YouTube. We'll double-check with you before we destroy it, as there is no undo.

The next item concerns a local Recording of your broadcast.

<samp>{% inlineicon magnify 15 inverted %}Show File Button{% endinlineicon %} Show File</samp> - click to reveal the local video file in your Mac's Finder.

## Logging out of YouTube

Ecamm Live will stay logged into YouTube unless you manually log out.

If you'd like to log out of YouTube, with <samp>YouTube</samp> selected in the <samp>Destination</samp> menu, go to the Ecamm Live menu at the top of your display, and select <samp>Log out</samp>. In the Main Window, we'll ask to confirm before logging you out. Click <samp>Log out</samp> and it will be so.
