title: Broadcast to YouTube
---

Broadcasting to YouTube starts in the <samp>Destination</samp> menu, in the bottom right of the Main Window. Select <samp>YouTube</samp>. The YouTube Login button will appear at the bottom of the Main Window.

If you've never logged into YouTube with Ecamm Live, click <samp class="blue">Login</samp> now, and follow through the prompts.

If you haven't broadcasted live to your YouTube account previously, you'll need to enable the option by visiting [your Live Dashboard first](<https://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard_splash>), before you'll be able to broadcast to YouTube. Otherwise, you'll see you a message to do so.

Once you're logged in, you can begin a live broadcast immediately by clicking <samp class="blue">Go Live</samp>, but there are a couple of options you'll want to check out first.

## YouTube Live Broadcast Options

YouTube assigns a category to its live broadcasts. You can choose your category under <samp>Options</samp> ➝ <samp>YouTube Video Category</samp>.

Under the <samp>Destination</samp> menu, you have two options to set. 

<samp>Broadcast to</samp> ➝ <samp>Public</samp>, <samp>Unlisted</samp>, <samp>Private</samp>.

* <samp>Public</samp> will create a video that shows on your channel.
* <samp>Unlisted</samp> will create a video that is available only if the viewer has a direct link to the broadcast. It will be otherwise unfindable to the public.
* <samp>Private</samp> will create a video that is only available to you.

<samp>Go Live</samp> ➝ <samp>Now (Unscheduled)</samp> or <samp>New Scheduled Live…</samp>

<samp>Now (Unscheduled)</samp> will begin your video without a prior announcement.

<samp>New Scheduled Live…</samp> will allow you to set a date and time for a live broadcast, as well as create a title and description.

### Going Live Now

If you select <samp>Go Live</samp> ➝ <samp>Now (Unscheduled)</samp>, give your broadcast a title and description by filling in the Title and Description fields in the lower left corner of the Main Window. Then click <samp class="blue">Go Live</samp>.

### Creating a New Scheduled Live

If you want to announce a broadcast ahead of time, select <samp>Go Live</samp> ➝ <samp>New Scheduled Live…</samp>. An editor appears to allow you to set a date and time for a live broadcast, as well as create a title and description. You can also add an image to your announcement by dragging an image file onto the cicle on the right side of the post editor. Complete the process by clicking <samp>Schedule</samp>.

Once you have scheduled a Live broadcast, any pending broadcasts are listed in the <samp>Go Live</samp> menu. When a pending broadcast is selected there, in the bottom left corner of the Main Window, you'll now see a countdown timer, which lists the time left until you go live. Click the timer to view or edit the announcement post that was created on YouTube. It will open in your default web browser. Also, there's a {% inlineicon trash 15 inverted %}Trash Button{% endinlineicon %} trash icon for cancelling the scheduled broadcast.

Before the countdown reaches zero, the big blue button displays <samp class="blue">Preview</samp>. Pressing <samp class="blue">Preview</samp> allows you to test your streaming connection prior to the beginning of your scheduled live broadcast. The preview stream is only visible to the broadcaster. Visit the post announcing your Live broadcast on YouTube (which you can do by clicking the countdown timer) and there will be a small link at the bottom of the post labeled <samp>Broadcaster Only: Edit Your Details</samp>. Click this to view the space where your stream will appear, and in a few seconds, you'll be able to preview your live stream. If, while you're previewing the stream, the countdown to your Live broadcast ends, your preview will become the Live broadcast automatically.

## Ending a YouTube Live Broadcast

Click <samp class="blue">Finish</samp>.

(That's it.)

## Post-broadcast options

After clicking <samp class="blue">Finish</samp> we'll present you with a message confirming your broadcast has ended, and offer several options for your next steps.

On YouTube, a recording of your Live broadcast is now available within your account, according to your <samp>Broadcast to</samp> settings, automatically. 

<samp>{% inlineicon visible 15 inverted %}View Post{% endinlineicon %} View Post</samp> - click to reveal the post in your default web browser.

<samp>{% inlineicon trash 15 inverted %}Trash Button{% endinlineicon %} Delete Post</samp> - click to remove the post from YouTube. We'll double-check with you before we destroy it, as there is no undo.

The next item concerns a local recording of your broadcast.

<samp>{% inlineicon magnify 15 inverted %}Show File Button{% endinlineicon %} Show File</samp> - click to reveal the local video file in your Mac's Finder.

## Logging out of YouTube

Ecamm Live will stay logged into YouTube unless you manually log out.

If you'd like to log out of YouTube, with <samp>YouTube</samp> selected in the <samp>Destination</samp> menu, go to the Ecamm Live menu at the top of your display, and select <samp>Log out</samp>. In the Main Window, we'll ask to confirm before logging you out. Click <samp>Log out</samp> and it will be so.
