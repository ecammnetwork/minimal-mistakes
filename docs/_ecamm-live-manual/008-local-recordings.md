<!-- ## Local Recordings of Your Broadcasts -->

By default, Ecamm Live keeps a local, full-quality recording of every broadcast you produce through the app.

### Retrieving Your Past Recordings

The <samp>Recording</samp> Menu at the top of your display holds the tools you need to enable or disable automatic recording, a way to get at your past recordings, and even change the location of where you want your recordings saved. By default, Ecamm Live saves your recorded videos in a subfolder of your macOS user's Documents folder.

#### An Aside on the Location of your Recordings

If you have a cloud storage service mirroring the location of the Ecamm Live Recordings folder, you should be aware this could impact the quality of your live broadcasts. For example, Apple offers a feature for their iCloud cloud storage product called [iCloud Desktop and Documents](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT206985) which mirrors the Documents folder to iCloud automatically. The Documents folder is where Ecamm Live stores your Recordings by default.

You may consume your cloud data storage pretty quickly if you keep the Ecamm Recordings folder in a cloud-sync'd folder—videos tend to be large files. Second, if you are recording while streaming—which is the default behavior—you will be both uploading your stream to the internet and, simultaneously, you'll be uploading the recording to your cloud storage. This may saturate your internet connection's upload capabilities, which could degrade the quality and stability of your feed.

These concerns apply to any cloud storage provider (Dropbox, Google Drive, OneDrive, Box, etc.) you may have setup to mirror your Documents folder, or if you choose to place the Ecamm Live Recordings folder in a location that automatically uploads files. That said, if storage space and internet bandwidth are not concerns of yours, there's no reason you can't use these services with the Ecamm Live Recordings folder. We recommend experimenting with the best fit for your situation.

You may change your Recordings storage location by selecting <samp>Recording</samp> ➝ <samp>Choose Recordings Folder…</samp> from the menu bar at the top of your display.

## Record Only Mode

Ecamm Live features a mode to record locally only. When you choose this mode, all features that are not Facebook-specific are available for you to record a video offline. This is great for a number of tasks, such as practicing before doing a live broadcast, pre-recording sections of a broadcast for later use, or simply to create videos for non-streaming situations like vlogs or tutorials.

To enable Record-only mode, in the bottom right corner of the Main Window, select <samp>Record Only</samp> from the <samp>Destination</samp> menu.
