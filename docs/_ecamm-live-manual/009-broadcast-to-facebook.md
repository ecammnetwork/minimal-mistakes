{: .notice}

In the <samp>Destination</samp> menu in the bottom corner of the Main Window, select <samp>Facebook</samp>, in the bottom-right of the Main Window. A big blue button at the bottom-center of the Main Window will display either:

* <samp class="blue">Login</samp> — click to login to Facebook and connect the app.
* <samp class="blue">Go Live</samp> —  you're logged into Facebook. Click to begin a live broadcast.

## Login to Facebook

Click the blue <samp class="blue">Login</samp> button to summon Facebook's login screen. Enter your credentials, and if you use two-factor authentication, you'll be asked for that code as well.

Once logged in, Ecamm Live will then ask for permission to post to your timeline and other locations within Facebook. This is necessary to publish live streams. If you manage Pages or Groups (for example for a business or other organization), Ecamm Live will also prompt for permission to manage Pages and Groups.

If you need to change these permissions later, visit the [Facebook Business Integrations page](https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=business_tools) and click on <samp>Ecamm Live for Mac</samp>. If you have trouble broadcasting to a particular destination, come back to these settings within Facebook to ensure you're allowing access as intended.

Once you're logged in, you're only one click away from your first Facebook Live broadcast. However, you'll want to verify where and how you are broadcasting to Facebook first. In the bottom right corner, you'll see several pull down menus appearing below the <samp>Destination</samp> menu.

![Figure\: Destination Menus Options for Facebook labeled](/assets/img/facebook-destination-menus.png "Destination Options for Facebook"){:width="400px"}

* <samp>Post as</samp> — Select **who** the broadcast will appear from. The menu includes your personal Profile and all Pages that you administer.

![Figure\: Post As Menu Options labeled](/assets/img/facebook-destination-post-as-menu.png "Post As Options"){:width="400px"}

* <samp>Post to</samp> — Select **where** your Facebook Live broadcast will appear, and your options depend upon who you're posting as. If you're posting as yourself, options include your personal Profile, and any Groups you administer. if you have selected to post as a Page, you'll see options for the Page's timeline and any Groups linked to that Page. When posting to your personal Profile, you'll see privacy options to choose from, like <samp>Profile (Just Friends)</samp> which allow you to restrict your audience.

You may also see additional Groups listed in the menu, that you do no administer. These are Groups where an administrator has enabled the Ecamm Live app.

<aside class="notice--warning" markdown="1">
#### Adding Ecamm Live to a Facebook Group

In order to use Ecamm Live with a Facebook Group, a Group admin must add Ecamm Live to the Group. To do this, go to the Group's "Group Settings" screen on Facebook's website. You'll see an <samp>Add Apps</samp> button. Click this and then choose Ecamm Live from the list of apps.

You'll only have to do this once per Group. Once enabled, all Group members will see Ecamm Live listed in Ecamm Live's <samp>Post to</samp> menu.  
</aside>

* <samp>Go Live</samp> — Select **when** your broadcast will post to Facebook. Your choices are <samp>Now</samp> and <samp>New Scheduled Live…</samp>

## Going Live Now

If you select <samp>Go Live</samp> ➝ <samp>Now (Unscheduled)</samp> you may click the big blue button labeled <samp class="blue">Go Live</samp> in the Main Window to broadcast immediately, or first create a Facebook Post to accompany the video.

To create a post for your Live broadcast, in the bottom left corner of the Main Window, you'll see a <samp>Description</samp> field and a map pin icon. Text entered in the <samp>Description</samp> field will become the text of the post that accompanies your Facebook Live broadcast.

Clicking the{% inlineicon locbutton 15 inverted %}Map Pin icon{% endinlineicon %}map pin allows you to tell Facebook where you're broadcasting from, which will be noted in your Facebook Live announcement.

Once you've added the content for the post, click the big blue button labeled <samp class="blue">Go Live</samp> in the Main Window to broadcast immediately.

## Creating a New Scheduled Live

If you select <samp>Go Live</samp> ➝ <samp>New Scheduled Live</samp>, a sheet appears to help you create a Scheduled Live broadcast, with a description and time for the broadcast. These will create an announcement post on Facebook at the <samp>Post to</samp> location. At the time you choose, between ten minutes from <em>now</em> and seven days from now, the announcement will turn into a live video post. If you'd like an image to accompany the announcement, drag an image onto the circular icon on the right side of the post editor. You may click the {% inlineicon locbutton 15 inverted %}Map Pin icon{% endinlineicon %}map pin icon to add a location for the broadcast.

[![Figure\: Scheduled Live Announcement Post Editor, annotated](/assets/img/facebook-scheduled-live-editor.png "Scheduled Live Announcement Post Editor. Click for full-size image.")](/assets/img/facebook-scheduled-live-editor.png)

Once you have scheduled a Live broadcast, any pending broadcasts are listed in the <samp>Go Live</samp> menu. When a pending broadcast is selected there, in the bottom center area of the Main Window, you'll now see a countdown timer, which lists the time left until you go live, and a <samp>View Post</samp> button. Click the <samp>View Post</samp> button to view or edit the post details on Facebook. It will open in your web browser. Also, there's a {% inlineicon trash 10 graybutton %}Trash Button{% endinlineicon %} trash button for cancelling the scheduled broadcast.

#### Starting Early

Once the countdown reaches 20 minutes, the countdown button will turn blue, indicating that early start is available. Click the countdown to start the broadcast before the scheduled time.

#### Starting On Time

Once the countdown reaches zero, the countdown will change to a <samp class="blue">Go Live Now</samp> button. Click the button to begin your broadcast.

#### Embedding The Broadcast

The broadcast can be embedded into other places. This can be a great thing for your audience extending your reach. To get the embed URL for a stream, once a stream has been scheduled or started, pick <samp>Copy Embed URL</samp> from the <samp>Edit</samp> menu. This will allow you to embed a video player with your broadcast elsewhere online. Alternatively, <samp>Copy Embed HTML</samp> will provide an HTML snippet containing an `IFRAME`. This will allow you embed a video player on a page on the web.

## View Viewer Comments and Reactions

During broadcasts, any comments or reactions your audience makes on your live broadcast will be displayed in the Comments and Reactions window. If you don't see this window, pick it from <samp>Windows</samp> menu at the top of the screen. Additionally, during a broadcast, if there are comments, you'll see a {% inlineicon comment 20 graybutton %}Comment Button{% endinlineicon %} button in the bottom left-hand corner of the Main Window to reveal the Comments and Reaction window.

#### Restrictions on Group Comments

Due to Facebook privacy restrictions, when broadcasting to a closed or private Facebook Group, Ecamm Live is not able to display Group member names and profile photos unless the Group members have explicitly granted permission to the Ecamm Live app. This means that comments from Group members who have not granted permission will show up anonymously.

![Figure\: Comments & Reactions Window with an anonymous Group comment](/assets/img/group_comments.png "Comments & Reactions Window with an anonymous Group comment"){:width="425px"}

#### Inviting Group Members to Grant Permission

To invite Group members to grant their permission, click the <samp>Invite Group Members</samp> button at the bottom of the Comments and Reactions Window. The window will change to display an invitation link. Provide this link to Group members.

There is also a checkbox for automatically adding this link to your broadcast's post  description on Facebook.

![Figure\: Comments & Reactions Window showing invitation link](/assets/img/group_code.png "Comments & Reactions Window showing invitation link"){:width="334px"}

The link will display a web page where Group members can log into Facebook and grant permission to Ecamm Live.

![Figure\: ecamm.live/connect web page](/assets/img/permission.png "ecamm.live/connect web page"){:width="547px"}


Group members will only need to do this once, and from that point on, comments in Ecamm Live will show up with their name and profile photo.

The code number provided in the link is unique to you and the Group, so it can also be used as a link to invite viewer to your broadcast.

<aside markdown="1" class="notice">
Note that the above information about anonymous comments and inviting Group members only applies to **Facebook Groups**. Public live streams to a Facebook Profile or business Page will display all comments and their associated names and profile photos without any special action by viewers.
</aside>

#### Display Comments on Your Broadcast

If you would like to share your viewers' comments with the audience, you can add individual comments to the broadcast by dragging them from the Comments and Reactions window to the Main Window, or clicking <samp>Add to Broadcast</samp> under any comment. The comment will become a styled Text Overlay. Read more about your options in the [Overlays section](/ecamm-live-manual/006-using-overlays/#comment-overlays).

<aside markdown="1" class="notice">
#### A note about delay in Live broadcasts

Live broadcasts have a delay. This is delay is not generated by Ecamm Live. Everyone who watches (including you viewing your test stream) will be roughly 10 seconds behind you. Keep this in mind when interacting with the audience, as any feedback they provide will be significantly behind you.
</aside>

## Ending a Facebook Live Broadcast

Click <samp class="blue">Finish</samp> or type <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>E</kbd> to end the broadcast.

## After a Facebook Live Broadcast

After clicking <samp class="blue">Finish</samp> we'll present you with a message confirming your broadcast has ended, and offer several options for your next steps.

Your Live broadcast is now a post on Facebook.

<samp>{% inlineicon visible 15 inverted %}View Post{% endinlineicon %} View Post</samp> - click to reveal the post in your default web browser.

<samp>{% inlineicon trash 15 inverted %}Trash Button{% endinlineicon %} Delete Post</samp> - click to remove the post from Facebook. We'll double-check with you before we destroy it, as there is no undo. This button is only available when posting to a Facebook Business Page. 

The next two items concern a local Recording of your broadcast. Much more on Recordings in the [Local Recordings](../010-local-recordings) section, but for now…

<samp>{% inlineicon magnify 15 inverted %}Show File Button{% endinlineicon %} Show File</samp> - click to reveal the recording file in your Mac's Finder.

<samp>{% inlineicon yt 15 inverted %}Send To YouTube Button{% endinlineicon %} Send To YouTube</samp> - click to send the recording to your YouTube channel.

If you've never used the YouTube feature, you'll be asked to sign in when you press the <samp>{% inlineicon yt 15 inverted %}Send To YouTube Button{% endinlineicon %} Send To YouTube</samp> button. You'll then be presented with a form to add information about your upload, and set its visibility options.

## Logging out of Facebook

Ecamm Live will stay logged into Facebook unless you manually log out, or if you remove permissions for Ecamm Live in Facebook's account settings.

If you'd like to log out of Facebook, first make sure <samp>Facebook</samp> is selected in the <samp>Destination</samp> menu. Then go to the <samp>Ecamm Live</samp> menu at the top of your display, and select <samp>Log Out Facebook</samp>. In the Main Window, we'll ask to confirm before logging you out. Pick <samp>Log Out</samp>.

## Advanced Settings for Facebook Live

To change Facebook-specific settings, choose <samp>Preferences</samp> from the <samp>Ecamm Live</samp> menu at the top of the screen beside the  menu. Pick <Samp>Facebook</samp> from the tabs at the top of the Preferences window.

#### Show Title Field

If you would like to enter a Title for your broadcast, pick this checkbox in the Facebook section of the Preferences. This title only appears on Facebook when a viewer with a desktop browser clicks on the broadcast. It _will not appear on news feeds or for mobile viewers._ 

#### Ambient Broadcast

Ambient broadcasts—also called continuous broadcasts—are a special kind of live stream that

* Can exceed Facebook's four-hour Live broadcast time limit 
* Will disappear from your timeline immediately when the stream ends 
* Does not send notifications to followers

Facebook suggests these live streams are ideal for places like aquariums, museums, and zoos. If you're interested in running an Ambient broadcast, enable it in the Facebook section of the Preferences.

#### Disallow Embedding

The video player your Live broadcast resides in can be embedded into places you have not specifically choose to broadcast, within Facebook, or on the web, but there are times you may prefer to disallow it. To disallow embedding, check this checkbox in the Facebook section of the Preferences.

### Business Page Settings (Pro Only)

Choose a Business Page in the Facebook section of the Preferences to configure settings for automatic crossposting and branded content. These settings are only available with an Ecamm Live Pro subscription.

#### Automatic Business Page Crossposting (Pro Only)

Automatic crossposting is a Facebook feature that will automatically present your broadcast on more than one Business Page. Note that this does not apply to Groups, and that comments and reactions will not show up between the crossposted Business Pages.

Business pages that have crossposting relationships will be listed automatically. Establish cross-posting relationships using the Page's Crossposting settings on the Facebook website. To find the Crossposting setting, got a Page that you administer on facebook.com. Click the "Settings" link in the top-right corner to view the Page's settings. In the left-hand sidebar, you'll see <samp>Crossposting</samp>.

#### Broadcasting Branded Content (Pro Only)

Facebook policies require creators and publishers to tag their business partners in their [branded content posts](https://www.facebook.com/help/publisher/1045927788843932?helpref=page_content#). When setting up a Live broadcast that involves a business partner, enter a Sponsor ID.

<aside class="notice--warning" markdown="1">
#### Don't Get into Trouble—a legal aside

Facebook places restrictions upon the content you put in Live broadcasts. Restrictions include no placement of third-party video ads in your live video. For example, don't include bumpers, pre-roll, mid-roll or post-roll ads. Ensure any pre-recorded content is clearly distinguishable from live content. Don't broadcast copyrighted material—music, video, TV, etc.—that you don't own the rights to. Facebook monitors broadcasts. They will auto-detect copyrighted materials and disable your use of Facebook Live broadcasting. There may be additional restrictions, including some specific to your jurisdiction.

We are not lawyers. You should [refer to Facebook's Terms and Policies for full details on their rules.](https://www.facebook.com/policies) _Phew._ Let's get back to the fun stuff.
