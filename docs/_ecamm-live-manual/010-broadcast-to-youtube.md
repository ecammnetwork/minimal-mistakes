title: Broadcasting to YouTube
---

Broadcasting to YouTube starts in the <samp>Destination</samp> menu, in the bottom right of the Main Window. Select <samp>YouTube</samp>. The YouTube Login button will appear at the bottom of the Main Window.

If you've never logged into YouTube with Ecamm Live, click <samp class="blue">Login</samp> now, and follow through the prompts.

If you haven't broadcasted live to your YouTube account previously, you'll need to enable the option by visiting [your Live Dashboard first](<https://www.youtube.com/live_dashboard_splash>). Otherwise, you'll see a message to do so.

![Figure\: Screenshot of what happens if you've not enabled live streaming first when you try to broadcast.](/assets/img/yt-live-not-enabled.png "A warning message if your YouTube Live streaming is not yet enabled. "){:width="400px"}

If you're still receiving this message after enabling live streaming on YouTube, ensure that you have enabled it for the correct YouTube channel. (Ecamm Live and your web browser may looking at a different YouTube channel.) To switch to a different YouTube channel in Ecamm Live, [log out of YouTube](#logging-out-of-youtube), and then log back in. You'll see a screen to select a channel during the login process.

Once you're logged in, you can begin a live broadcast immediately by clicking <samp class="blue">Go Live</samp>, but there are a couple of options you'll want to check out first.

## YouTube Live Broadcast Options

YouTube settings can be found in the YouTube section of Ecamm Live's Preferences. To access Preferences, click the gear button near the top right corner of Ecamm Live's main window.

#### Category

YouTube assigns a category to its live broadcasts.

#### Stream Latency

Adjusting stream latency will change the time it takes for your stream to become visible to viewers. However lower latency settings are more subject to buffering if there is a slowdown or an interruption in internet upload speed. Ultra-low latency mode is not compatible with stream sizes higher than 1080.

#### Made For Kids

YouTube requires broadcasters to indicate whether or not a broadcast is Made For Kids. Note that if your YouTube channel is set to Made for Kids, this checkbox will be pre-selected.

#### Privacy

Under the <samp>Destination</samp> menu, you have two options to set. 

<samp>Broadcast to</samp> ➝ <samp>Public</samp>, <samp>Unlisted</samp>, <samp>Private</samp>.

* <samp>Public</samp> will create a video that shows on your channel.
* <samp>Unlisted</samp> will create a video that is available only if the viewer has a direct link to the broadcast. It will be otherwise unfindable to the public.
* <samp>Private</samp> will create a video that is only available to you.

#### Scheduling

<samp>Now (Unscheduled)</samp> will begin your live broadcast as a new live event without a prior announcement.

<samp>New Scheduled Live…</samp> will allow you to set a date and time for a live broadcast event, as well as create a title, description and thumbnail image.

### Going Live Now

If you select <samp>Go Live</samp> ➝ <samp>Now (Unscheduled)</samp>, give your broadcast a title and description by filling in the title and description fields in the lower left corner of the Main Window. 

To go live, click <samp class="blue">Go Live</samp>.

### Creating a New Scheduled Live

If you want to announce a broadcast ahead of time, select <samp>Go Live</samp> ➝ <samp>New Scheduled Live…</samp>. An editor appears to allow you to set a date and time for a live broadcast, as well as create a title and description. You can also add an image to your announcement by dragging an image file onto the thumbnail area on the right side of the post editor. Complete the process by clicking <samp>Schedule</samp>.

Once you have scheduled a Live broadcast, any pending broadcasts are listed in the <samp>Go Live</samp> menu. When a pending broadcast is selected there, in the bottom center area of the Main Window, you'll now see a countdown timer, which lists the time left until you go live, and a <samp>View Post</samp> button. Click the <samp>View Post</samp> button or the {% inlineicon settings 10 graybutton %}Event Dashboard{% endinlineicon %} button to view or edit the post details on YouTube. It will open in your web browser. To visit the event's YouTube Studio Room page, click the {% inlineicon controlroom 10 graybutton %}Screen Icon{% endinlineicon %} button. Also, there's a {% inlineicon trash 10 graybutton %}Trash Button{% endinlineicon %} trash button for cancelling the scheduled broadcast.

#### Starting Early

Once the countdown reaches 20 minutes, the countdown button will turn blue, indicating that early start is available. Click the countdown to start the broadcast before the scheduled time.

#### Starting On Time

Once the countdown reaches zero, the countdown will change to a <samp class="blue">Go Live Now</samp> button. Click the button to begin your broadcast.

#### Embedding The Broadcast and Live Chat

The broadcast can be embedded into other places. To get the embed URL for a stream, once a stream has been scheduled or started, pick <samp>Copy Embed URL</samp> from the <samp>Edit</samp> menu. This will allow you to embed a video player with your broadcast elsewhere online. Alternatively, <samp>Copy Embed HTML</samp> will provide an HTML snippet containing an `IFRAME`. This will allow you to embed a video player on a page on the web.

You can also embed YouTube's live chat by picking <samp>Copy Chat Embed URL</samp>

## View Live Chat Messages and Reactions

During broadcasts, any YouTube live chat messages and reactions that your audience adds to your live broadcast will be displayed in the Comments and Reactions window. Additionally, at the top of the Main Window we'll display a live count of viewers, visible only to you.

## Display Comments on Your Broadcast

If you would like to share your viewers' comments with the audience, you can add individual comments to the broadcast by dragging them from the Comments and Reactions window to the Main Window, or clicking <samp>Add to Broadcast</samp> under any comment. The comment will become a styled Text Overlay. Read more about your options in the [Overlays section](/ecamm-live-manual/003-using-overlays/#comment-overlays).

## Ending a YouTube Live Broadcast

Click <samp class="blue">Finish</samp> or type <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>E</kbd> to end the broadcast.

## Post-broadcast options

After clicking <samp class="blue">Finish</samp> we'll present you with a message confirming your broadcast has ended, and offer options for your next steps.

On YouTube, your Live broadcast is now a video on your channel. 

<samp>{% inlineicon visible 15 inverted %}View Post{% endinlineicon %} View Post</samp> - click to reveal the YouTube video in your default web browser.

<samp>{% inlineicon trash 15 inverted %}Trash Button{% endinlineicon %} Delete Post</samp> - click to remove the video from YouTube. We'll double-check with you before we destroy it, as there is no undo.

<samp>{% inlineicon magnify 15 inverted %}Show File Button{% endinlineicon %} Show File</samp> - Ecamm Live automatically creates a local recording of your broadcast. Click this to reveal the video file in the Mac's Finder.

## Changing YouTube Channels

To change to a different YouTube channel linked to your account, pick <samp>Change YouTube Account...</samp> from the <samp>Ecamm Live</samp> menu at the top of your display.

## Logging out of YouTube

Ecamm Live will stay logged into YouTube unless you manually log out.

If you'd like to log out of YouTube, with <samp>YouTube</samp> selected in the <samp>Destination</samp> menu, go to the <samp>Ecamm Live</samp> menu at the top of your display, and select <samp>Log Out YouTube</samp>.
