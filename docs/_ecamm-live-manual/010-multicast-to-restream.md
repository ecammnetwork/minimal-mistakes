[Restream.io](https://www.restream.io) is a cloud-based service for live streaming to multiple platforms.  To use Restream in Ecamm Live, select <samp>Restream.io</samp> in the Destination menu. The Restream <samp class="blue">Login</samp> button will appear at the bottom of the Main Window.

If you’ve never logged into Restream with Ecamm Live, click <samp class="blue">Login</samp> now. You’ll be greeted with the same options you have to log into Restream on the web.

Configure multicasting channels on your [Restream dashboard](https://restream.io/channel). Once set up, you can begin broadcasting by clicking <samp class="blue">Go Live</samp>. 

## View Viewer Comments

Restream has the ability to aggregate chat comments from 20+ platforms via their [Restream Chat](https://restream.io/chat) feature. During broadcasts, any chat comments, Periscope super hearts and YouTube Super Chats your audience makes on your live broadcast will be displayed in the Comments and Reactions window. 

Reactions such as Facebook likes and Periscope hearts, and viewer count are not available when using Restream.

## Display Comments on Your Broadcast

If you would like to share your viewers' comments with the audience, you can add individual comments to the broadcast by dragging them from the Comments and Reactions window to the Main Window, or clicking <samp>Add to Broadcast</samp> under any comment. The comment will become a styled Text Overlay. Read more about your options in the [Overlays section](/ecamm-live-manual/003-using-overlays/#comment-overlays).

## Ending a Restream Broadcast

Click <samp class="blue">Finish</samp>.

(That’s it.)

## Post-broadcast options

After clicking <samp class="blue">Finish</samp> we’ll present you with a message confirming your broadcast has ended, and offer two options for your next steps.

<samp>{% inlineicon magnify 15 inverted %}Show File Button{% endinlineicon %} Show File</samp> - click to reveal the local video file in your Mac’s Finder.

<samp>{% inlineicon yt 15 inverted %}Send To YouTube Button{% endinlineicon %} Send To YouTube</samp> - click to send the local video file to your YouTube Account.
If you’ve never used the YouTube feature, you’ll be asked to sign in when you press the <samp>Send To YouTube</samp> button. You’ll then be presented with a form to add information about your upload, and set its visibility options. Once you’ve uploaded, you can close the dialog box or you can click to <samp>Go To YouTube</samp> to view your upload.

## Logging out of Restream.io

Ecamm Live will stay logged into Restream.io unless you manually log out.

In the Main Window, we’ll ask to confirm before logging you out. Click <samp>Log Out</samp> and it will be so.
