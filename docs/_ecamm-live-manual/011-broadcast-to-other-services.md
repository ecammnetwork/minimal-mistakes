## Broadcasting to LinkedIn Live

LinkedIn Live is currently available to approved users only. [See here](https://www.ecamm.com/linkedinlive) for details.
{: .notice}

Broadcasting to LinkedIn starts in the <samp>Destination</samp> menu, in the bottom right of the Main Window. Select <samp>LinkedIn</samp>. The LinkedIn <samp class="blue">Login</samp> button will appear at the bottom of the Main Window.

If you’ve never logged into LinkedIn with Ecamm Live, click <samp class="blue">Login</samp> now. You’ll be greeted with the same options you have to log into LinkedIn on the web.

Once you’re logged in, you can dive straight in by clicking <samp class="blue">Go Live</samp>, but there are a couple of options you’ll want to check out first.

In the bottom left of the Main Window, you’ll see the words <samp>Enter a description…</samp> Click the words to enter the description that will display along with your live stream.

#### Ending a LinkedIn Broadcast

Click <samp class="blue">Finish</samp> or type <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>E</kbd> to end the broadcast.

#### Post-broadcast options

After clicking <samp class="blue">Finish</samp> we’ll present you with a message confirming your broadcast has ended, and offer several options for your next steps.

On LinkedIn, a recording of your Live broadcast is now available as part of your timeline, automatically. 

<samp>{% inlineicon visible 15 inverted %}View Post{% endinlineicon %} View Post</samp> - click to reveal the post in your default web browser.

The next two items concern a local recording of your broadcast.

<samp>{% inlineicon magnify 15 inverted %}Show File Button{% endinlineicon %} Show File</samp> - click to reveal the local video file in your Mac’s Finder.

<samp>{% inlineicon yt 15 inverted %}Send To YouTube Button{% endinlineicon %} Send To YouTube</samp> - click to send the local video file to your YouTube Account.
If you’ve never used the YouTube feature, you’ll be asked to sign in when you press the <samp>Send To YouTube</samp> button. You’ll then be presented with a form to add information about your upload, and set its visibility options. Once you’ve uploaded, you can close the dialog box or you can click to <samp>Go To YouTube</samp> to view your upload.

#### Logging out of LinkedIn

Ecamm Live will stay logged into LinkedIn unless you manually log out, or if you remove Ecamm Live from [your LinkedIn Permitted Services](https://www.linkedin.com/psettings/permitted-services).
If you’d like to log out of LinkedIn, with <samp>LinkedIn</samp> selected in the <samp>Destination</samp> menu, go to the <samp>Ecamm Live</samp> menu at the top of your display, and select <samp>Log Out LinkedIn</samp>.

## Using a Stream Key

Ecamm Live can produce broadcasts on many live streaming services that support the _Real-time Messaging Protocol,_ more commonly known as RTMP. Services that use RTMP include [Wowza](https://www.wowza.com/products/streaming-cloud) and [Crowdcast](https://www.crowdcast.io).

To start streaming to a RTMP-capable service, you'll need two pieces of information:

* **Server URL** — this will look like a web address, except it will say *rtmp://* or *rtmps://* at the beginning.
* **Stream Key** — this is like a password, so that Ecamm Live can establish a connection with the address and allowing it to accept your video

Every service is a little different with regard to finding this information. To connect to your service, in the bottom right corner of the Main Window, select <samp>Custom Stream Key</samp> from the <samp>Destination</samp> menu. A sheet will appear to accept your Server URL and Stream Key.

**_Note:_** Certain features of Ecamm Live—such as Comments and Reactions, and Scheduled Live broadcasts—are not available while streaming to RTMP services.

#### Stream Key Login and Password

Rarely, some RTMP services may require a login and password. ([Dacast](http://dacast.com) is one example.) Use the <samp>Provide Login and Password</samp> checkbox to add this.

#### Broadcast to Wowza with an RTMP Stream Key

If you need to broadcast to Wowza Streaming Cloud, there are a few extra steps to set up your stream on Wowza's site. We have instructions to walk you through [Streaming to Wowza Streaming Cloud](https://support.ecamm.com/en/articles/3280029-streaming-to-wowza-streaming-cloud/) available to guide you.
