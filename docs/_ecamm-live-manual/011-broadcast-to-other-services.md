## Broadcasting to Periscope

Broadcasting to Periscope starts in the <samp>Destination</samp> menu, in the bottom right of the Main Window. Select <samp>Periscope</samp>. The Periscope <samp class="blue">Login</samp> button will appear at the bottom of the Main Window.

If you’ve never logged into Periscope with Ecamm Live, click <samp class="blue">Login</samp> now. You’ll be greeted with the same options you have to log into Periscope on the web.

Once you’re logged in, you can dive straight in by clicking <samp class="blue">Go Live</samp>, but there are a couple of options you’ll want to check out first.

In the bottom left of the Main Window, you’ll see the words <samp>Enter a description…</samp> Click the words to enter the description that will display along with your live stream. This description is also important for the Twitter posting option discussed below.

### Periscope Preferences

To change Persiscope-specific settings, choose <samp>Preferences</samp> from the <samp>Ecamm Live</samp> menu at the top of the screen beside the  menu. Pick <Samp>Periscope</samp> from the tabs at the top of the Preferences window.

#### Share Broadcast on Twitter

Select this option to have Periscope send a tweet inviting your Twitter followers to join you for your broadcast. The text of the tweet Periscope sends is the description, detailed above, and a link to the stream. If you go live without a description, and with this setting enabled, your tweet will be a Periscope link without description—which on Twitter’s apps and site will show as a _video_ without a description.

#### Use Secure Connection

This can help if you’re having trouble with your connection to Periscope. Networks typically treat secure connections differently than standard connections. The opposite is also true: if you’re broadcasting with the secure connection and having trouble, you can disable this setting.

### View Viewer Comments and Hearts

During broadcasts, any comments, hearts or super hearts your audience makes on your live broadcast will be displayed in the Comments and Reactions window. Additionally, at the top of the Main Window we'll display a live count of viewers, visible only to you.

### Display Comments on Your Broadcast

If you would like to share your viewers' comments with the audience, you can add individual comments to the broadcast by dragging them from the Comments and Reactions window to the Main Window, or clicking <samp>Add to Broadcast</samp> under any comment. The comment will become a styled Text Overlay. Read more about your options in the [Overlays section](/ecamm-live-manual/003-using-overlays/#comment-overlays).

### Ending a Periscope Broadcast

Click <samp class="blue">Finish</samp> or type <kbd>⌘</kbd><kbd>E</kbd> to end the broadcast.

### Post-broadcast options

After clicking <samp class="blue">Finish</samp> we’ll present you with a message confirming your broadcast has ended, and offer several options for your next steps.

On Periscope, a recording of your Live broadcast is now available as part of your profile, automatically. 

<samp>{% inlineicon visible 15 inverted %}View Post{% endinlineicon %} View Post</samp> - click to reveal the post in your default web browser.

<samp>{% inlineicon trash 15 inverted %}Trash Button{% endinlineicon %} Delete Post</samp> - click to remove the post from Periscope. We’ll double-check with you before we destroy it, as there is no undo.

The next two items concern a local recording of your broadcast.

<samp>{% inlineicon magnify 15 inverted %}Show File Button{% endinlineicon %} Show File</samp> - click to reveal the local video file in your Mac’s Finder.

<samp>{% inlineicon yt 15 inverted %}Send To YouTube Button{% endinlineicon %} Send To YouTube</samp> - click to send the local video file to your YouTube Account.
If you’ve never used the YouTube feature, you’ll be asked to sign in when you press the <samp>Send To YouTube</samp> button. You’ll then be presented with a form to add information about your upload, and set its visibility options. Once you’ve uploaded, you can close the dialog box or you can click to <samp>Go To YouTube</samp> to view your upload.

## Using a Stream Key

Ecamm Live can produce broadcasts on many live streaming services that support the _Real-time Messaging Protocol,_ more commonly known as RTMP. Services that use RTMP include [Wowza](https://www.wowza.com/products/streaming-cloud) and [Crowdcast](https://www.crowdcast.io).

To start streaming to a RTMP-capable service, you'll need two pieces of information:

* **Server URL** — this will look like a web address, except it will say *rtmp://* or *rtmps://* at the beginning.
* **Stream Key** — this is like a password, so that Ecamm Live can establish a connection with the address and allowing it to accept your video

Every service is a little different with regard to finding this information. To connect to your service, in the bottom right corner of the Main Window, select <samp>Custom Stream Key</samp> from the <samp>Destination</samp> menu. A sheet will appear to accept your Server URL and Stream Key.

**_Note:_** Certain features of Ecamm Live—such as Comments and Reactions, and Scheduled Live broadcasts—are not available while streaming to RTMP services.

### Broadcast to Wowza with an RTMP Stream Key

If you need to broadcast to Wowza Streaming Cloud, there are a few extra steps to set up your stream on Wowza's site. We have instructions to walk you through [Streaming to Wowza Streaming Cloud](http://ecamm.com/support/article/2218/streaming-to-wowza-streaming-cloud/) available to guide you.
