[Switchboard Live](https://www.switchboard.live) is a cloud-based service for live streaming to multiple platforms.  To use Switchboard in Ecamm Live, select <samp>Switchboard Live</samp> in the Destination menu. The Switchboard <samp class="blue">Login</samp> button will appear at the bottom of the Main Window.

If you’ve never logged into Switchboard with Ecamm Live, click <samp class="blue">Login</samp> now. You’ll be greeted with the same options you have to log into Switchboard on the web.

Configure multicasting workflows on your [Switchboard Cloud dashboard](https://cloud.switchboard.live/connect/streams). Once set up, you'll see your Switchboard Cloud workflows listed in the <samp>Post to</samp> menu below the <samp>Destination</samp> menu.  Pick a workflow, and then begin broadcasting by clicking <samp class="blue">Go Live</samp>. 

Comments, reactions such as Facebook likes and Periscope hearts, and viewer count are not available when using Switchboard.

## Ending a Switchboard Broadcast

Click <samp class="blue">Finish</samp>.

(That’s it.)

## Post-broadcast options

After clicking <samp class="blue">Finish</samp> we’ll present you with a message confirming your broadcast has ended, and offer two options for your next steps.

<samp>{% inlineicon magnify 15 inverted %}Show File Button{% endinlineicon %} Show File</samp> - click to reveal the local video file in your Mac’s Finder.

<samp>{% inlineicon yt 15 inverted %}Send To YouTube Button{% endinlineicon %} Send To YouTube</samp> - click to send the local video file to your YouTube Account.
If you’ve never used the YouTube feature, you’ll be asked to sign in when you press the <samp>Send To YouTube</samp> button. You’ll then be presented with a form to add information about your upload, and set its visibility options. Once you’ve uploaded, you can close the dialog box or you can click to <samp>Go To YouTube</samp> to view your upload.
