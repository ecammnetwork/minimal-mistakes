<!-- ## Other Options -->

There are a few other helpful options in the Preferences. To find Ecamm Live's Preferences, choose <samp>Preferences</samp> from the <samp>Ecamm Live</samp> menu at the top of the screen beside the  menu. 

### General Preferences

#### Sound Effects

Ecamm Live will play a sound when comments arrive. Viewers may hear the sounds if you use speakers during the broadcast, while Ecamm Live's echo cancellation feature is deactivated.

#### Show Controls While In Other Apps

While you're live, if you switch to another app, a small floating control window will be displayed. This control window allows you to see what's being broadcast, and includes buttons to change [Scenes](../005-using-scenes) and Source modes, as well as a <samp class="blue">Finish</samp> button.

#### Keep Utility Windows In Front While Live 

While broadcasting or recording, the control windows such as the Scenes window and Overlays window will always remain visible above all other windows, even when in another app.


### Account Preferences

#### Manage Account

Your Ecamm Live account is what you use to identify yourself and your Ecamm Live subscription. Click <samp>Manage Account</samp> to change your name, email address or password.

#### Manage Billing

If you have an active Ecamm Live subscription, you'll see a <samp>Manage Billing</samp> button. Click this to update your billing information, view, download and print invoices, or cancel your subscription.


### Stream Preferences

#### Stream Size

Choose from 540p, 720p, or 1080p. 

Facebook's standard livestream size is 720p. You may wish to choose the smaller option for streaming to Periscope, or if your internet connection's upload speed is insufficient for 720p.

While Facebook will accept a 1080p video stream, it does not currently offer the ability to _view_ a stream at this resolution. Other streaming destinations such as YouTube fully support 1080p broadcasts.

The stream size cannot be changed during a broadcast.

Note that higher stream sizes will require a faster internet connection.

#### Stream Shape

Choose from Wide (16x9), Classic (4x3), Square, and Tall (9x16), or choose the Aspect ratio of your Mac's display. The last option allows you to use 360° Cameras.

9x16 is like a mobile display held in portrait orientation. 16x9 is like an HDTV screen, and 4x3 is like standard definition televisions before HD. Square is, well, square.

The stream shape cannot be changed during a broadcast.

#### Use High Quality Video

Ecamm Live streams at a bit rate that balances the amount of data we send over the internet and the visual clarity of your video. If you want to broadcast in higher bit rate, and your upload speed is fast enough, you can select this option. During a broadcast, you can turn change this setting by clicking the <samp>HD</samp> button at the top of the main window.

This will require a sustained minimum of 4 Mbps (megabits per second) for your internet upload speed when using a 720p stream size. If at any point your connection cannot sustain this, Ecamm will automatically reduce the bit rate so that the broadcast may continue.

#### Use High Quality Audio

In most cases, Ecamm Live's default audio bitrate is sufficient.  However, some broadcasters such as musicians, may wish to increase the audio bitrate by enabling this option. This option cannot be changed during a broadcast.


### Video Preferences

#### Crop in Splitscreen Mode

By default, a two- or three-camera split-screen camera layout will crop the left and right side of the camera image.  If you would prefer to use letterboxing instead of cropping, uncheck this option.

#### Use Fade Transition

When this option is enabled, a cross-fade transition will be used when changing Scenes or source modes.

#### Fade Out When Finished

When this option is enabled, Ecamm Live's video stream will fade to black when the Finish button is clicked.

#### Auto-Play Video Files

When this option is enabled, Ecamm Live's Video File source mode will begin playback automatically when a video file is picked, when Video File source mode is entered, or when a broadcast or recording starts while in Video File source mode. When thich option is disabled, you'll need to press the play button or press the spacebar to start video playback.


### Audio Preferences

#### Use Echo Cancellation

Use this checkbox to toggle [Echo Cancellation](../004-source-modes/#echo-cancellation).

#### Broadcast System Audio

By default, Ecamm Live will broadcast your Mac's system audio when in [Screenshare mode](../004-source-modes/#screen-share). Change this setting to either never broadcast system audio, or to broadcast system audio all the time.

#### Automatically Mute Microphone During Video Playback

By default, the microphone will be muted when in video playback mode with no picture-in-picture. Uncheck this checkbox to turn off auto-mute.


### Screen Sharing Preferences

#### Include Desktop Icons

Show the desktop ions when sharing the entire screen.

#### Include Desktop Picture

Show the desktop image when sharing the screen. Turn this off to use a black background instead.

#### Add Margin When Zooming to an App Window

Add a small margin around windows when automatically zooming to an app or app window.

#### Optimize for Better Quality or Higher Frame Rate

When using the Better Quality setting, you may notice a reduced screen capture frame rate when sharing movie playback in a browser. To prevent this, use the Higher Frame Rate setting.
  
#### Include Mouse Cursor

Include the mouse cursor in the broadcast.

#### Mouse Cursor Size

Select a custom mouse cursor size.

Mouse clicks will be indicated with a small circle around the mouse cursor.
