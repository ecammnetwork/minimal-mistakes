<!-- ## Other Options -->

There are a few other helpful options in the <samp>Options</samp> menu at the top of the screen.

### Stream Size

<samp>Options</samp> menu ➝ <samp>Stream Size</samp>. Choose from 540p, 720p, or 1080p. 

Facebook's standard livestream size is 720p. You may wish to choose the smaller option for streaming to Periscope, or if your internet connection's upload speed is insufficient for 720p.

While Facebook will accept a 1080p video stream, it does not currently offer the ability to _view_ a stream at this resolution. Other streaming destinations such as YouTube fully support 1080p broadcasts.

The stream size cannot be changed during a broadcast.

Note that higher stream sizes will require a faster internet connection.

### Stream Aspect

<samp>Options</samp> menu ➝ <samp>Stream Aspect</samp>. Choose from Wide (16x9), Classic (4x3), Square, and Tall (9x16), or choose the Aspect ratio of your Mac's display. The last option allows you to use 360° Cameras.

Think of "aspect" as "shape"—9x16 is like a mobile display held in portrait orientation. 16x9 is like an HDTV screen, and 4x3 is like standard definition televisions before HD. Square is, well, square.

The stream shape cannot be changed during a broadcast.

### Use High Quality Video

Ecamm Live streams at a bit rate that balances the amount of data we send over the internet and the visual clarity of your video. If you want to broadcast in higher bit rate, and your upload speed is fast enough, you can select <samp>Options</samp> menu ➝ <samp>Use High Quality Video</samp>, or during a broadcast by clicking the <samp>HD</samp> button at the top of the screen. 

This will require a sustained minimum of 4 Mbps (megabits per second) for your internet upload speed when using a 720p stream size. If at any point your connection cannot sustain this, Ecamm will automatically reduce the bit rate so that the broadcast may continue.

### Use High Quality Audio

In most cases, Ecamm Live's default audio bitrate is sufficient.  However, some broadcasters such as musicians, may wish to increase the audio bitrate by enabling this option. This option cannot be changed during a broadcast.

### Crop in Splitscreen Mode

By default, a two- or three-camera split-screen camera layout will crop the left and right side of the camera image.  If you would prefer to use letterboxing instead of cropping, uncheck this option.

### Fade Out When Finished

When this option is enabled, Ecamm Live's video stream will fade to black when the Finish button is clicked.

### Sound Effects

Ecamm Live will play a sound when comments arrive. Viewers may hear the sounds if you use speakers during the broadcast, while Ecamm Live's echo cancellation feature is deactivated. If you don’t want Ecamm to make sound effects, select <samp>Options</samp> ➝ <samp>Sound Effects</samp> (the checkmark will disappear).
