Ecamm Live has powerful capabilities allowing you to bring guests into your live broadcasts. In this tutorial, we'll show you how to do it in the most basic way. Then we'll show you how additional tools can make your show even more professional with overlays and scenes. Let's dig right in and see how to set this all up.

## What You Need to Bring Remote Guests into a Broadcast

Interviewing guests is one of the most popular features of Ecamm Live. Conducting interviews requires two additional tools. The first is the Skype app for your Mac, with a Skype account. If you don't have Skype yet, visit Skype.com and follow their instructions for installation and account setup.

The next tool you need is **Ecamm Call Recorder for Skype**. As of Ecamm Live 2.2, Call Recorder is included with your purchase. If you have a version of Ecamm Live 2 less than 2.2, at the top of the screen click <samp>Ecamm Live</samp> menu ➝ <samp>Check for Updates</samp>. Updating Ecamm Live will put Call Recorder on your Mac (see [below for installation](#install-call-recorder-for-skype)).

When you're running both your live broadcast and maintaining a Skype call, you'll need to make sure you have enough internet bandwidth to maintain both at an acceptable quality. A minimum of 4 Mbps is required by Ecamm Live for a high quality broadcast, and 1Mbps for a bare minimum. 

Skype's requirements vary based on how many people you have on a call. Roughly, you need 1.5 Mbps upload and download speed to maintain an HD call, and to maintain a call with 5 people, you need a minimum of 4 Mbps download. Skypes support site provides further specifics on [Skype's bandwidth requirements](https://support.skype.com/en/faq/FA1417/how-much-bandwidth-does-skype-need).

You can learn more about bandwidth and its effect on streaming broadcasts [in this note on internet connections in the Ecamm Live Manual](/ecamm-live-manual/007-broadcast-to-rtmp/#a-technical-aside-about-internet-connections). This is particularly helpful if you're experiencing any issues, or if the quality of your broadcasts is lower than you expect.

## Install Call Recorder for Skype

If Call Recorder is not already installed on your system, Ecamm Live can install it automatically. Simply select <samp>Camera</samp> menu ➝ <samp>Add Skype Guests</samp>, and Call Recorder will begin installing. Once it is installed, launch Skype and you will see the Call Recorder interface appear. Call Recorder runs as an add-on to Skype for Mac. It won't show up in your Applications folder. You do not need to launch it. It will automatically appear each time Skype launches.

**Note:** Only _Call Recorder for Skype_ works with Ecamm Live. Call Recorder for FaceTime is not compatible with Ecamm Live.

Once Call Recorder is installed, there is no additional setup in Ecamm Live. The app will detect guests on your calls and make them available for your broadcasts as a Camera source.

**ProTip:** if you don't have someone to connect with on Skype to run through this tutorial, set up a second Skype account on another device. Place it across the room---close enough to control it, but far enough away that you won't cause audio feedback when all the mics are live.
