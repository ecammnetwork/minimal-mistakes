There we areâ€”a simple, and a sophisticated way to integrate remote guests into your live broadcasts via Skype. You can just call someone on Skype, fire up Ecamm Live, and go live in seconds. Or, you can choose to make it a more sophisticated, integrating other features from Ecamm Live.

Let us know how you make out with your remote interviews, as always, we love to hear from our customers. [Shoot us a note on our feedback form](/feedback/index) to let us know what you thought of this tutorial or what you think of the software in general.
