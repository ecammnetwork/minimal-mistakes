## • A Tutorial • 

In this tutorial, we’ll discuss how to do a single camera, “talking head”-style Facebook Live broadcast. You’ll see how Ecamm Live tools, along with a little planning and preparation, can help you make a simple and impactful Facebook Live broadcast.

* Before You Broadcast: A basic setup for Facebook Live.
* How to start and perform your very first stream using Facebook Live.
* How to end your stream, and what to do next.
* Bonus: Your *second* stream—with Overlays and Scenes.
* Recap.

Note: If you’ve never opened Ecamm Live before, you may want to read the [first couple of paragraphs of the User’s Manual](/docs/ecamm-live-manual/001-manual-intro) describing what happens the first time you open the app, and get a tour of the app’s Main Window. Throughout this tutorial, we’ll link out to important concepts in the [Ecamm Live Online User’s Manual.](/docs/ecamm-live-manual/) If you need additional information, click out, then come back here and continue when you’re ready.
