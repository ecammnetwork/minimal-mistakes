# Your First Time Around with Ecamm Live
(see also the [First Facebook Live tutorial]() for the bare essentials from first-run to your first Facebook Live broadcast)

Upon opening Ecamm Live, you’ll be greeted by the Main Window, and several smaller windows. 
The Main Window
The Main Window is your monitor of what your audience sees, with exception to the tools we’ve laid on top of this window—and your cursor—which are only visible to you. You cannot close or minimize the Main Window, but you can resize it by placing your mouse over any edge or corner of the window.

The smaller windows are for control of [Sound Levels](), [Scenes](), [Overlays](), and [Facebook Comments and Reactions.]() If you dismiss any of these windows, you can bring them back by visiting the `Windows` menu at the very top of your Mac’s display.  Additionally, each of these windows has a keyboard shortcut assigned for easy access.

At the center bottom of the Main Window is a blue “Login” window, which will allow us to connect you to Facebook for broadcasting and scheduling broadcasts.

Note: If you’re not going to use Ecamm Live with Facebook, logging in is optional. You can still record to your Mac, and stream to services that use [RTMP](link to manual § on topic) with no need to log into Facebook.

Tools within the Main Window
At the top left of the Main Window is the `Scenes` pull-down button. The text of the button shows the name of your currently active Scene. Any other Scenes you’ve created are listed within the menu, giving you fast access to switching scenes during a stream or recording. Reference our section on Scenes more details on what Scenes are, and how to use them.

At the top center of the Main Window you’ll find Ecamm Live’s 3 primary modes— we call them Sources— you can use in your broadcast.

{display icon}#todo - Screen Share
{camera icon}#todo - Video File

The above links go to the manual sections for each source and explain each in exhaustive detail.

The top right of the Main Window contains two icons, the Sound Levels button, and the Overlays button. Both show or hide the windows for each tool.

{sound icon}#todo - Sound Levels
{Overlays icon}#todo - Overlays

The above links go to the manual sections for each source and explain each in detail.

The bottom right corner holds a selection of menus which control where your broadcasts go, and the options visible are dependent upon which settings you’ve selected.

If you’re logged into Facebook, and have Destination: Facebook selected, you’ll see an assortment of options of where to broadcast. You can choose who can view your broadcast within Facebook, and control when to broadcast.

If you select Custom Stream Key, a sheet will appear over the window with the settings required to stream to a non-Facebook video platform.

Lastly, if you select “Record Only”, all the other options fade away, and you’re now set to capture a recording on your Mac.

The bottom center of the Main Window holds the big blue button which depending on the destinations settings can read,

Log in
(DIscussed above)[#anchor] If you’re not logged in, but have the Destination set to “Facebook”
Go Live
If you’re logged into Facebook and have the Destination set to “Facebook”, or  if you’re using a stream key.
Record
If your Destination is set to “Record Only”

When logged into Facebook, the bottom left corner of the Main Window includes a {Pin icon}#todo location pin and description field. Text entered in the Description field will become the text of the post that accompanies your Facebook Live broadcast.

Note: We have [a detailed section on Facebook Live](#link) later in this manual.  We discuss Custom Stream Keys and how to connect to other video services in the [Broadcasting to Other Services](#link) section.
